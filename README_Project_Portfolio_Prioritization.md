# Project Portfolio Prioritization Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on prioritizing a portfolio of projects by evaluating them based on business impact and delivery effort. The objective is to support leadership in making data-driven, transparent, and defensible decisions when allocating limited resources across competing initiatives.

The solution combines an Excel-based scoring model with an interactive Tableau dashboard to rank projects and visualize prioritization outcomes.

## Business Objective
Organizations often manage multiple initiatives simultaneously under constraints such as limited budget, time, and delivery capacity. This project aims to:
- Score projects using standardized impact and effort criteria
- Rank projects using a composite prioritization metric
- Visually identify high-priority, low-priority, and strategic initiatives
- Enable stakeholders to make informed portfolio-level decisions

---

## Methodology

### Scoring Framework
Projects are evaluated across two dimensions:

**Impact (Value Drivers):**
- Growth Enablement
- Risk Shielding
- Customer Leverage
- Operational Relief

**Effort (Delivery Constraints):**
- Delivery Effort
- Time Sensitivity

All criteria are scored on a 1–5 scale.

### Composite Priority Index (CPI)
A Composite Priority Index (CPI) is calculated to balance value against effort:

CPI = Weighted Impact Score / Delivery Friction Score

Higher CPI values indicate higher-priority projects.

### Portfolio Classification
Based on CPI and Delivery Friction, projects are categorized into:
- Quick Win – High value, low effort
- Strategic Bet – High value, high effort
- Efficiency Play – Moderate value, low effort
- Deprioritize – Low value relative to effort

Each category is mapped to a recommended management action.
